# Roadmap to success

1. Establish a clear, shared vision.
	- A vision must be matched to metrics of success
2. Evolve to a more "open" culture.
	- Trasparency
	- Culture is the operating system of the entire organization.
3. Build cross-organizational teams
	- You must first have a vision & culture of trust
	- 58% of developers say they are the primary decision makers
	- Make DevOps more than a hype phrase
4. Develop personal digital skills
	- Use open source to attract and develop talent
5. Build inclusive and diverse teams
6. Make it personal
